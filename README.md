# Meatball
Meatball is a project that focus on adding specific features for Raylib. For now I am making User Interface related things but later I might jump to other stuff such as threading or asynchronous, 3d and multiplayer. 

# I'm not smort 🤡
I taught C++ myself and I don't know the best practices for the language and if I actually should care as much as I care about performance and using the right data types for range specific variables. If you see anything that seems stupid or just a bad idea feel free to fix it or create a issue 👍.
