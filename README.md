# Meatball
Meatball is a project that focus on adding specific features for Raylib. For now I am making User Interface related things but later I might jump to other stuff such as threading or asynchronous, 3d and multiplayer. 


# I'm not smort ü§°
I taught C++ myself and I don't know the best practices for the language and if I actually should care as much as I care about performance and using the right data types for range specific variables. If you see anything that seems stupid or just a bad idea feel free to fix it or create a issue üëç.

# .meatdata files
.meatdata is a file extension that should be used to store user interface data such as a object color/style/radius/etc. I want users to be able to change their menus styles and also program something cool, so that's why this exist.

# .cpmd files
.cpmd is a file extension that is currently in progress. All it focus on is low storage usage and that programs can read .meatdata faster now that is serialized. As I said before, this is currently being made so do not expect to have a great performance difference with it.
