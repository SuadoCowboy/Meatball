# Meatball
Meatball is a project that focus on adding specific features for Raylib. For now I am making User Interface related things but later I might jump to other stuff such as threading or asynchronous, 3d and multiplayer. 

# Optimization
I'm also looking for using the minimum possible of variables and cpu usage if possible. Not that my code is actually 100% optimized as I know it still fails on that, but in the end I might try to clean it a little and use low memory.

## Lots of pointers
This might actually make the code have a lot of pointers and references but that's the cost of it: Readability.

## Why would I do that instead of being a normal person?
I know what is like to not being able to play games because of having a bad pc.

# I'm not smort ü§°
I taught C++ myself and I don't know the best practices for the language as well if I actually should care as much as I care about performance and using the right number data types for range especific variables. If you see anything that seems stupid or just a bad idea feel free to fix it or tell me üëç.

# .meatdata files
.meatdata is a file extension that should be used to store user interface data such as a object color/style/radius/etc. I want users to be able to change their menus styles and also program something cool, so that's why this exist.
