# Meatball
Meatball is a project that focus on adding specific features for Raylib. For now I am making User Interface related things but later I might jump to other stuff

# .meatdata files
.meatdata is a file extension that should be used to store user interface data such as a object color/style/radius/etc. I want users to be able to change their menus styles and also program something cool, so that's why this exist.
