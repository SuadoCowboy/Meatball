# Meatball
Meatball is a project that focuses on having modifiable features for the players. For now I am making User Interface related things but later I might jump to other stuff such as threading or asynchronous, 3d and multiplayer. 

# Input
Each keyboard/mouse/joystick key/button is stored with a string in a unordered_map. Those strings are interpreted by SweatCI whenever their keys/buttons are pressed.

# Quick Note From The Code Owner
I taught C++ myself and I don't know the best practices for the language and if I actually should care as much as I care about performance and using the right data types for range specific variables. If you see anything that seems stupid or just a bad idea feel free to fix it or create an issue üëç.
